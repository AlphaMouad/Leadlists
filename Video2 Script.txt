Hey heeey what’s going on guys it's mouad here from prospectify AI and if you're watching this video right now chances are you come to our website maybe you had a look around and watch some of our videos but you didn't yet book a call with us to see how we can actually help you use ai and hyper personalization to grow your agency.


so i filmed this quick video to walk you through how you can actually apply Prospectify AI technology and get 8-10X roi and make it something that is going to fuel your business with profit, I’ll show you the exact tools that got me from booking barely a couple meetings every single week for my agency to booking at least 30 qualified sales calls every single month
consistently look I've been in the agency space for over three years I have to say over the years there has been one consistent and recurring problem that initially stopped me from just scaling my agency right and reaching my goals guess what it was it was booking sales calls and meetings right my service delivery has always been amazing however
As you know, winning new business can be a roadblock for most entrepreneurs, getting a full pipeline with quality brands consistently can be a challenge too. But with AI, we can now automate tasks that can take a sales team weeks to complete, and immediately create more of a level playing field. 
Low Quality Traffic and Targeting Decision Makers in Paid Ads
One of the biggest struggles fo r agency owners is getting high-quality traffic and effectively targeting the right decision makers via paid ads. This can lead to unprofitable campaigns and low booking rates. To overcome this challenge, consider using a prepaid card, such as Suica or Pasmo, which can be used on most metros and bus services and topped up at stations2. Additionally, it's important to be smarter about which paid traffic sources you are using and when, and how much to invest in each2.
Competitiveness in Cold Outbound Marketing
Another challenge is the competitiveness in cold outbound marketing. Cold calling, for example, has a low success rate and can be time-consuming and frustrating. Instead, consider alternatives such as cold email outreach, social media marketing, content marketing, and influencer marketing4. Outsourcing your B2B sales prospecting and cold calling can also help you generate highly qualified leads without the costs associated with hiring and managing an entire sales team internally.
Increasing Booking Rate Without Sacrificing Time, Effort, and Money
Lastly, increasing the booking rate without sacrificing time, effort, and money can be a challenge. To overcome this, consider building advanced processes with the right tech, such as a commission-free booking engine that’s also mobile-friendly11. Additionally, you can use a variety of outbound prospecting methods that include cold email, social media, LinkedIn, SEO, and more8.
Remember that there are several challenges that come with running an agency, but with the right strategies and mindset, you can overcome them and build a successful business.


 versus weigh you down with more things to learn and more things to do if you’re watching this more than likely you fall into one of three buckets you're running facebook ads right now and you're struggling to keep campaigns profitable due to the low quality traffic and the inability to effectively target the right decision makers via Paid ads. or you’re already doing cold outbound and you want to get an edge on your competitors that’ll make your campaigns a lot more effective, increasing your booking rate by 5-10X or you might just be doing outbound and organic marketing to generate new leads and you want to increase your booking rate without sacrificing the amount of time and effort and money that it costs you to acquire customers.


now the good news is it does not matter which bucket you fall into and we can 100 help you decrease your customer acquisition costs while also increasing your lead flow using AI outbound dominator but rather than me talking about it and sharing a bunch of success stories let me show you how you can do it in application and how quickly you can get a return on investment guaranteed.


now the first one i want to walk you through that's extremely unique and is not actually available anywhere else in the world by any other company is our site prequalification…so regardless again of whether you're an agency or you're just looking to scale up your own business what we can do with our site visitor pixel is identify website visitors without an opt-in on your site so if you've got 10 000 visitors coming to your site and you're only getting one percent opt-in we can reveal at least fifty to sixty percent of that remaining percentage of people that are not opting it and so instantly you're gonna have more leads secondly we're gonna get their full personal and business contact infos we have a database of 350 million contacts and it's verified and updated every single day so every time someone hits that pixel or comes to your site on a landing page we're gonna ping our what's called an identity graph and we're gonna see do we have that contact in our database and more than likely we have that contact or at least some contact info we can give you which will be in the form of a hash and an email that you can then use to retarget people on whatever platform that you want and then thirdly you're going to be able to automatically add them into follow-up campaigns which is what i'm going to show you in a second and you can model conversions and retarget your site visitors forever so if you are in the bucket of running ads on facebook and you're getting crushed by the attribution window using the site wizard pixel every time that you run an ad or get someone to come to the website we're going to resolve their identity so you don't have to worry about the attribution window in fact we have agencies that are taking their site visitors and re-uploading them as a look-alike audience and getting tremendous results on facebook so you now own and control your targeting you're going to have the identities of people coming to your website you're going to have more ammo to feed facebook and facebook's ai is going to do an even better job of targeting the right people and getting you that lower customer acquisition costs now let's see how this works in implementation of retargeting so every time a website visitor comes they're going to get plugged into our site visitor pixel which means you can retarget them forever and you now own and control that data using our zapier integration you can automatically send an email which i give you the frameworks for the zap for and everything you need to segment people based off of which pages they visit on your website we can also add them to a linkedin outreach campaign and by the way we have a linkedin outreach platform built into our platform so you can do this all in one spot and we show you exactly how to do it and then lastly you can build custom audiences and look like audiences for your ads like i spoke about a minute ago so automating adding people in a custom audience through zapier throwing them to youtube ads facebook google ads or even display ads now the result of that is you're gonna have increased lead flow obviously your retargeting window is forever decreased customer acquisition costs and using an omni channel strategy and not having to just use facebook is going to increase your probability of converting people by 300 percent because you're on more than one channel now when we look at monetization obviously you can use this all on your own website for lead generation and you can also use it for your clients if you're just doing it for yourself we charge 500 bucks a month to be able to get access to the pixel and to be able to download your leads every single day using our technology and if you're doing that you get a little bit of traffic on your website where you start running ads to your website you're going to be able to recoup that investment pretty freaking fast but if you have an agency you can do it even faster because if you have people with high traffic websites already or you're already running traffic you're going to be able to get a huge influx of leads straight away and you're going to make your clients very very happy which means you can charge them more for this particular service there's a couple different models you can use here one of them is charging per lead so you can offer this as another service set it up for them and charge people per lead as you start to generate leads from people who abandon cart or who didn't book a call and what you're doing is you're just capturing everything that they were unable to get before so you're milking uh really everything that you can out of the traffic that they already have going to their site you don't really have to do anything additional now of course you can also do a cpa where you get paid per sale that they make and manage this entire process you can even resell the pixel for five or seven times what we charge for it we have companies that go out and they resell tons of these pixels for 1500 or 2 grand a month and they just send their clients the file of their site visitors and they use that for their own retargeting very simple to do and you can do all that inside our platform last but not least you can also charge a retainer for setup and maintenance now this is just one of the growth lanes that we have using one of our one of our features and this is something that is not available anywhere else we are the only platform in the world that can do this i don't say that in a cocky way i say it because this is a huge opportunity for you to differentiate yourself and get an edge and no matter what niche or industry that you're in now in addition to that we also have growth line number two and we like to call that restructured hyper growth now our second product that's inside intent right now is restruct and what we do is we use our 300 million person contact database to resolve the identity of people using linkedin urls facebook urls and emails or hashes and so you can think of it as we have a giant spreadsheet in the air with 300 million plus contacts and 5 000 plus columns of data on all these people so if you're able to give me a linkedin url or tell me where to go get a linkedin url in a group or someone's followers or do the same thing on facebook get a facebook url we can put that into our system and i can append an email to that url and then give you the contact info and the business info for those people so what does that actually mean that means that if you have niche facebook groups that let's say your customers are in that you want to target currently right now there is no way to do that there's no way to get the identity of those people but through intent.io we can resolve the identity and we teach you how to target niche facebook groups on any platform same thing with linkedin for we have a linkedin url we can enrich that to a full email and a business record and allow you to target them on facebook and so really at the end of the day we're able to build custom lists from our database and append missing contact fields for your own list and just like the site visitor pixel as you go through this process and we give you the identity of these people and niche groups followers who engage with posts that are relevant to your industry you're going to be able to retarget them forever and you can push them through a web hook or upload them via csv into warm email campaigns linkedin campaigns custom audiences and look like audiences on any platform and the monetization models are pretty similar you can do cpa cpl direct outreach paid media you know pick your boys in there however you want to do it and you're going to be able to increase your ltv of your clients by improving results for your current and future clients so if you're already running ads you're already doing outreach all you have to do is inject these leads that are hyper targeted from groups and uh you know people that are influencers in your space and you put those into your campaign and what you're doing is you're telling facebook and google not to target people that are not actually in your target market which is a huge step forward and it gives them facebook and google and every other platform or to work with for their own algorithms and of course you can uh upsell your clients in stat towards the retainer however you choose to do it now once you understand that everything i'm taking you through we're going to teach you how to do in the platform there's a community in there you're going to have the tools the strategies and playbooks to set it up and make it plug and play for your business so you can get up and running as fast as possible and scale as fast as you want but if you want to go even faster we do have a very exotic option in our arsenal inside the intent.io platform called in-market domination and this is a technology that essentially analyzes 40 billion behaviors every single day across 5 billion urls on the internet who identify people who are in market for any particular product so if you give me a set of keywords that we know 95 of the time when someone searches this keyword you're probably looking to buy a solution similar to yours or products similar to yours or the problem that you solve and all we do is we take those keywords and we start resolving the identity of people clicking on urls that contain those keywords or searching those keywords on google and we compile those leads into a list and we assign them a lead score using ai by weighting different behaviors and attributing multiple behaviors to our 300 million person contact database and so what that means is we're able to basically predict where people are at in their customer journey and really tell you exactly what you need to show them at whatever time and spot inside that journey itself but to put it really simply every single day you can come in and download a list of every single in-market buyer for your product and we're gonna show you exactly where they are in their customer journey which keyword they're inbound for and how hot they are so you can send them the right message at the right time on the right platform every single time which allows you to establish frame control for every prospect earlier than your competitors because your competitors don't know they exist yet given the fact that this technology is exclusive to intent at io and nobody else in the world has it but most importantly you're going to become platform agnostic because you're going to have a list of every in-market lead you're not going to need to rely on facebook google or youtube to create your audiences for you at the very beginning you can come in with your own data that's already validated you inject that into these ad platforms and it's going to help you skip the learning phase of the ads so that they learn far faster exactly who you're trying to target and you're going to be able to literally two to three extra lead flow and drop your customer acquisition cost tremendously just by putting better data into these platforms did i mention that ios 14 is not an issue with our data you can actually target anyone on any platform on any device because we're going to give you their full contact record now just like the other growth lanes you can take this product and you can actually set up a way for them to go through a web hook or csv upload and add them into email campaigns linkedin or custom audiences and so really at the end of the day you open up a tremendous amount of new monetization models for both you and your client because you're able to get your site visitor leads from people coming to your website you're pulling in social leads from niche groups and niche influencers that are related to your products and services and then we're actually identifying people who are actively searching and looking for your product all across the internet so you can imagine with those three combined you're pretty much unstoppable and you can actually dominate any niche that you want now i know that this all sounds cool and you're probably wondering all right chase you know does this actually work uh let me see some case studies and so i'll just walk you through really quick a couple of examples so the sas company 30 days and they were able to add 4 million a month to their pipeline using end market leads and added about 700 average leads per month out of 50 000 customer value e-commerce website just using social leads they were able to get an 85 reduction in cost per click and a 400 percent return on their investment and just using the site visitor alone another sas company after 30 days got another extra 5 000 leads per month and 1.5 million per month added to their pipeline now of course i can sit here and walk you through more case studies but i would love to get you on the phone with our team for 15-20 minutes and go through your specific use case to see which of these strategies might be a good fit for you and how profitable that they might be and if they're not and none of them are good fit we will honestly tell you and we're not going to try and sell you something that you're not going to be able to use for your business because at the end of the day we are here to serve the growth marketing community we're not here to take your money we're here to help you get an roi so if what you saw today looks interesting enough you want to get that competitive edge and you want to see how you can actually
